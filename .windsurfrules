No function should have more than 7 logical statements. If a function exceeds this limit, it should be refactored into smaller, more manageable functions.
Each function should have a docstring that describes what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns.
Anywhere that dataframes are used, the docstring should include the names of the required and optional columns and their data types.
Code should be as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as practical.
Boilerplate should be minimized.
Docstrings should follow google style.
